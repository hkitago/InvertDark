# InvertDark for Safari Extension

This Safari extension quickly applies dark mode using color inversion and keeps it active as long as you need it. With one simple activation, dark mode stays on until you choose to change it, making browsing more comfortable across different websites and repeat visits.

Originally developed to address the problem of bright screens on HDR-compatible large monitors after sunset, this extension offers a quick and easy solution for stress-free nighttime browsing.

## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation

To install the extension on iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.
For macOS, open Safari, go to Safari > Settings > Extensions, and enable the extension from there.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Usage

1. Click the icon next to the address bar to activate the extension and apply dark mode.
2. If you want to disable dark mode or if the color inversion doesn't look right, simply click the icon again to revert the changes.

### Note:

If the extension does not function correctly immediately after installation, especially for iPhone users, please restart Safari or refresh the relevant page.  
This issue arises from technical limitations, and this design considers battery life and device performance. We appreciate your understanding and are prepared to respond quickly to any future updates from Apple that may address this issue.
